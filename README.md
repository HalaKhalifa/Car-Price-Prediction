# Car-Price-Prediction

build a service that takes information about a car and return the predicted price for that car. 



- use the text files to extract the features and information needed to train a model

- conduct an explorative data analysis for the data

- conduct data cleaning and transformation if needed

- conduct feature engineering

- select the best model for the problem between Polynomial Regression, kNN, and Decision Tree

- create a microservice that predicts the car price given certain input data

- the code should be shared in a private GitHub repo

- the link of the repository should be submitted to moodle before the deadline
